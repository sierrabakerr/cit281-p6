# Project 6

[RETURN TO HOMEPAGE](https://sierrabakerr.github.io/)


## Learning Objectives:

### After completing this project, you will:

Gain experience creating and working classes with inheritance

Gain more experience creating and working with classes

Gain more experience debugging code

Gain more experience using a generic block of code to process data

Gain more experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment

Gain more experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode

Practice using modern JavaScript syntax

Gain more experience working with static data


## Overview:

### Project elements:

You will be creating three classes. The first class is the Shape class that will serve as a base class for the other two classes. The second class is the Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class. A class that inherits from another class can be called the child class of the base, or parent, class. The third class is the Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.

The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value. 

### Tip: 
You should continue to use git to track completed versions of your code.


## Project Deliverables:
